    "description": "FrancoisHUP / CV\nOpen on GitHub\n\nDescription  \nA personal portfolio website that leverages React, TypeScript, and Three.js to create an interactive 3D experience.  \nProblem Solved: Demonstrates a creative and engaging way to showcase personal projects and skills, transcending traditional static portfolio pages.  \nImpact: Enhances user engagement and highlights technical expertise through real-time 3D graphics, improving the overall user experience.  \nRelevance: Demonstrates modern front-end development practices, including React with TypeScript, containerization using Docker, and 3D rendering, aligning with broader career goals in full-stack development and immersive web experiences.\n\nTechnologies Used  \n- React  \n- TypeScript  \n- Three.js  \n- React Three Fiber  \n- Docker  \n- Nginx  \n- Vite  \n- TailwindCSS  \n- Framer Motion  \n- GSAP  \n- Socket.IO Client\n\nRole: Lead Developer & Designer\n\nChallenges  \n- Integrating complex 3D rendering with React components and routing  \n- Ensuring performance optimizations for real-time animations  \n- Managing a containerized environment for smooth deployments\n\nArchitecture  \nThe system consists of a Docker Compose setup that builds and runs a React-based front-end served by Nginx. The front-end uses Three.js/React Three Fiber for 3D rendering, and React Router for page navigation.  \n- Docker Compose & Dockerfile: Defines the container environment, building a production-optimized React app and serving it via Nginx.  \n- React + Three.js Application: Renders the interactive 3D scene and portfolio UI, handling user interactions, routing, and state management.  \n- TailwindCSS & Framer Motion: Used for styling and animations, respectively, providing a responsive design and smooth UX transitions.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nDesign Decisions  \n- Using React Three Fiber for 3D rendering instead of a custom Three.js setup.: It seamlessly integrates with Reactâ€™s component architecture and allows reusing hooks and React patterns for 3D objects.  \n- Containerizing the application with Docker.: Ensures consistent environment across different machines and simplifies deployment.\n\nPerformance Optimizations  \n- Reduced geometry complexity and leveraged GPU acceleration in Three.js.: Improved rendering performance and maintained smooth frame rates.  \n- Used Vite for faster builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).: Reduced development build times, enabling quick iteration.\n\nLessons Learned  \n- Techniques for implementing advanced 3D graphics and interactions in a React application.  \n- Strategies for optimizing performance in real-time rendering scenarios.  \n- Best practices for Docker-based deployment with Nginx.",
