I have this 2048.txt file pulled from GitHub. There's a section that describes the architecture at the top, then you have the code.  
The code is separated with sections for every file:  

================================================  
File: path/name_file.py  
================================================  

I want you to extract as much information as possible from this file and organize it in a **hierarchical JSON structure**.  
The JSON should follow this schema:  

```json
